# project_mini_jeux_poo:

I have created methods specific to an object, they allow to always do the same action.
The method therefore takes as input a "player" object which is the player undergoing the attack,
The method begins by announcing "the player [name of player1] is attacking the player [name of player2]" with a "puts", 
Then we has calculated the damage that "player_1" will cause to "player_2",
we have created a separate method called compute_damage which will do this calculation.
